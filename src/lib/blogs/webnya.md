It started out with cassie being mildly upset that there were quite a lot of things I enjoyed being called, but she couldn't remember all of them.

She made a codepen with a list of modifiers and things and I half-jokingly asked "what if I used this as my personal site"

She actually said sure and thus webnya was born

I REALLY did not want to use vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.
After 10 minutes of googling reddit posts, I decided Svelte would be the best option.
